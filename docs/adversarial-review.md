# Adversarial Code Review

A method for reviewing pull requests where **every claim carries a reproduction or it doesn't ship**. Optimized for finding real correctness bugs (not style nits) in high-risk changes: security/compliance seams, algorithms, vendored code, async/concurrency, and anything that fails silently.

## The method

Five moves, in order.

### 1. Isolate & baseline
Review in a throwaway git worktree checked out at the PR head, so the working tree is never touched. `pull/<PR#>/head` is a *mutable* ref, so pin the SHA you reviewed rather than trusting the ref to sit still:

```bash
HEAD_SHA=$(gh pr view <PR#> --json headRefOid --jq .headRefOid)
BASE_SHA=$(gh pr view <PR#> --json baseRefOid --jq .baseRefOid)

git fetch <remote> pull/<PR#>/head
[ "$(git rev-parse FETCH_HEAD)" = "$HEAD_SHA" ] || exit 1   # force-push between the two calls
git worktree add --detach /tmp/review-<PR#> "$HEAD_SHA"
```

Check out the SHA, not the ref, and **re-check `headRefOid` immediately before posting** — if it moved, the findings describe one revision while the inline comments anchor to another, so re-run rather than post.

Give each sub-agent **its own worktree**. Anything that mutates the tree — mutation testing especially — corrupts a sibling agent's run otherwise, and the failures look like flaky tests rather than interference. Clear `__pycache__` after checkout for the same reason.

**A worktree isolates files, not execution.** Step 3 of this method runs the PR's code — its test suite, its dependency install, your repros — and that code is written by the PR author. On the reviewer's host it inherits the reviewer's processes, credentials, SSH agent, cloud tokens and network. For a PR from a fork or an unfamiliar author, that is arbitrary code execution, and the worktree does nothing about it.

So decide the trust level before running anything. A same-repo branch from a maintainer can run on the host. Anything else runs in a container — this repo ships one (`just sandbox-build claude`; see `sandbox/README.md`), but any minimal Python image works. Installing needs the network and reviewing does not, so split it in two and run the PR's code with **no network at all**:

```bash
# phase 1 — install only, still networked, nothing of the PR's executed yet
docker run --rm -v /tmp/review-<PR#>:/workspace -w /workspace claude-sandbox \
  uv sync --all-extras

# phase 2 — everything from here runs the PR's code, so cut the network
docker run --rm -it --network=none \
  -v /tmp/review-<PR#>:/workspace -w /workspace claude-sandbox bash
```

Mount only the disposable worktree and pass no env file and no host credentials. Note that phase 1 still executes the PR's `pyproject.toml` — a build backend can run arbitrary code at install time — so for a genuinely untrusted PR, read the packaging diff before running even that. Never source the PR's `.env`, run its git hooks, or `pre-commit install` from it. Keep `gh` calls and the review posting outside the sandbox — those are exactly the credentials you are keeping away from the code. If you cannot sandbox an untrusted PR, review it by reading and **say so in the review**; an unverified finding is the one thing this method does not allow.

Diff against `$BASE_SHA`, not a hard-coded `main`. A PR targeting a release or feature branch diffed against `main` will attribute pre-existing defects to it, or hide its changes entirely.

*Before* judging anything, run the project's lint / type / test commands and record the result. That's your baseline — it lets you separate PR-caused breakage from pre-existing environmental noise (a missing optional dep, deselected markers, a flaky unrelated test).

### 2. Fan out independent skeptics
Spawn several sub-agents, each scoped to **one** risk surface (core algorithm / integration / tests-and-packaging). They must not see each other's conclusions — independent agreement is signal, not echo. Tell each to **hunt for bugs and reproduce them**, not to summarize the code. Two or three agents is usually right; more just produces overlap.

### 3. Reproduce by execution, not eyeballing
A finding isn't real until it's been run. "Crashes on `tool_calls: None`" is worth nothing until you've watched it throw. Standalone repros (`uv run python -c "..."`, a scratch test, a one-off script) are the currency of the review.

### 4. Verify before you report
Re-run the agents' **headline** claims yourself. Agents are confidently wrong sometimes — catching a claim that's false *in the author's favor* matters as much as catching a bug. Only surface what survives your own repro.

### 5. Rank, separate, and credit
Blockers first, then high / medium / low. Distinguish verified from hypothesized. Say plainly which claimed fixes are genuinely correct so the author doesn't churn on the parts they nailed. A review that only lists faults is a worse review.

On a **re-review**, the status table is per *finding*, so load the individual findings and not just the review bodies — `gh api --paginate repos/<REPO>/pulls/<PR#>/reviews` for the verdicts and `.../comments` for the inline findings, correlated through `pull_request_review_id`. Paginate both; a long-running PR overflows one page, and a finding you silently dropped reads to the author as a finding you withdrew.

**Through-line: evidence over opinion.**

## Re-reviewing a fix

A fix round is the highest-risk code in a PR: written fast, under pressure, in a narrow window of attention, with the reviewer's framing in mind rather than the system's. Give it what you gave the original diff, plus three things that only apply the second time.

**Verify the fix against the class of input, not the string from your comment.** This is the commonest way a fix round fails. A fix checked against the reviewer's literal repro closes that input and leaves its neighbours open — and the result can be *worse* than the state it replaced, because the obvious case now passes while the obscure one still fails silently.

| reported | fix was verified against | what it missed |
|---|---|---|
| a ragged JSON array scored a false `1.0` | *all* resamples ragged | *some* resamples ragged — `0.85` became `1.0`, worse than the head it replaced |
| the escape repair corrupted `C:\new\data` | that exact string | `C:\temp` — one backslash run rather than two, so the evidence the guard relied on was consumed and it failed open |

After re-running the original repro, write down *what makes it work* and vary that: one element instead of all, one field instead of two, one backslash instead of two. If the fix keys on a property, feed it the input that lacks the property.

**Diff the whole fix commit, not only the lines you commented on.** A re-review scoped to "did they fix my findings" misses whatever else rode along. On one round here, four unreferenced prompt templates were added in a commit whose message described only review fixes; they shipped in the wheel and sdist and nothing in the package referenced them. They surfaced only because the file list got read before anchoring inline comments.

**Apply the reproduction standard to your own dismissals.** "I checked and it's fine" needs the evidence that "I checked and it's broken" needs. Twice in one review here a finding was called unreachable — once from probing the wrong input shape, once from reading a drop check and missing that a backfill rewrote the value just before it. Both dismissals were wrong. A finding you talk yourself out of is still a claim.

## Traps in this codebase

**A scoring finding is not verified until it has run through preprocessing.** `compute_json_step_consistency` invites being called directly — it takes a list of responses and a config — but `extract_parsed_responses_from_trajectory` decides what reaches it, and the two disagree in both directions. A response the scorer would reject is often dropped upstream and never arrives, so a scorer-level "regression" evaporates end to end. And the value production actually hands the scorer may be one the parser never returns: a backfilled `[]` rather than the parser's `{}`, for instance, which is what made one finding real that a scorer-only probe had shown as harmless.

Drive the real path:

```python
parsed  = extract_parsed_responses_from_trajectory(trajectory, config)
samples = parsed["steps"][0]["sampling"]["parsed_samples"]   # not step["parsed_responses"]
compute_json_step_consistency(samples, agent_config, min_samples)
```

The trajectory shape is `{"steps": [{"name": <an agent name from agent_config.yaml>, "sampling": {"raw_samples": [...], "num_samples": N}}]}`. `raw_samples` holds what `resampling.py` emits — a list of tool-call dicts, or a plain string when the model answered without calling a tool, which is the divergence most worth testing.

## The reusable sub-agent prompt

Fill in the bracketed parts, one instance per risk surface.

```text
Adversarial code review. Code is checked out at: <WORKTREE_PATH>
The PR's base commit is <BASE_SHA>; `git diff <BASE_SHA>...HEAD -- <path>`
shows only this PR's changes. Run every command <WHERE: on the host / inside
the review container, e.g. `docker exec <NAME> ...`>.

Focus ONLY on: <SPECIFIC FILES / ONE RISK SURFACE>.
(Another reviewer owns <the other areas> — do not duplicate.)

Context: <1–3 sentences on what the code does and any claims the author makes>.

If this is a RE-review, here are the previously-reported issues that were
supposedly fixed — verify each is ACTUALLY fixed AND that the fix introduced
no new bug:
  <list prior findings, or delete this block for a first review>

Your job: find REAL bugs by reasoning AND by executing. Be adversarial.
Specifically probe:
  1. Empty / degenerate / malformed inputs — write and RUN standalone repros
     (`cd <worktree> && uv run python -c "..."`). Try: empty collections,
     single elements, None/""/negative/huge values, missing keys, wrong types.
  2. Correctness of the core logic — off-by-one, shape/index bugs, wrong math,
     division-by-zero, NaN propagation, silently-swallowed exceptions,
     mutable defaults, incorrect normalization.
  3. Fail-open vs fail-closed — if this guards something (auth, PII, money,
     deletes), does an unexpected error let bad data THROUGH? State it plainly.
  4. Integration seams — every call site that reaches the risky path; anything
     that bypasses the intended choke point; breaking changes to public APIs.
  5. Test quality — are tests real assertions or over-mocked to pass trivially?
     Do they use the REAL dependency or a stub that hides the bug? What is the
     single highest-value MISSING test?

Rules:
  - Report ONLY findings you verified by reading or executing. No speculation.
  - For each finding: exact file:line, what's wrong, a concrete triggering
    input, and observed-vs-expected.
  - Rank by severity. Distinguish real bugs from cosmetic nits.
  - If a claimed fix is genuinely correct, say so plainly.
  - If the code is solid, say that — do NOT manufacture findings.
  - Be concise.
```

Two knobs to turn per PR:
- **Number of agents** = number of genuinely independent risk surfaces (usually 2–3). Overlapping scopes produce echo, not coverage.
- **"Be adversarial" + "don't manufacture findings"** always appear together. The first pushes them to dig; the second stops them inventing severity to look useful.

## Posting the review

- Draft first; show the human before posting.
- Structure: a summary body (a **status table crediting what's fixed** is great on re-reviews) plus inline comments anchored to `file:line` at the PR head SHA.
- Inline comments only attach to lines present in the diff. Files added wholesale are fully anchorable; for a change to an *unchanged* line, anchor to the nearest related diff line or put it in the body.
- Choose the verdict deliberately: `REQUEST_CHANGES` for a real correctness drop or several mediums; `COMMENT`/`APPROVE` when only nits remain.
